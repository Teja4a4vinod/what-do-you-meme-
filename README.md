This is my first project in web server programming course

I am Tejaswini Utlapalli and I am from India. I have completed my bachelor's degree in electronics and communications engineering.I have studied C language during my UG program and Learned Java programming in my first semester of master's program.
Right after completion of undergraduate studies, I secured a job at Mindtree Limited, a leading multinational IT and outsourcing company, I have completed 2.6 years of working in Mindtree. After joining in Mindtree, I have undergone the training on 4 modules (Database, Linux, Networking, and Windows) for the period of 3 months and after that I have been assigned to a project called “Catalina” which is one of the leading digital marketing companies. I contributed myself towards network operations center(NOC) for 1 year and worked as a part of the Database team for the remaining time. 
I have learned about different tools like Afaria, PRTG, Nagios, Salesforce, Mwatch, and technologies like Linux, Windows, Networking, and Virtual desktop infrastructure(VDI) when I worked as a NOC engineer.
During my tenure as a DB admin, I have learned about working on SQL, Oracle servers, and working on DBMS. I am currently on a sabbatical leave to study my master's and I will be going back to work for Mindtree Ltd after finishing my studies.
